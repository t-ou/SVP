# SVP
a Eclipse Plugin of SBFL and its visualization
I'm trying my best to develop it but it will still take some time to finish it.
## Principle
- Start as a Listener of JUnit5
- Use Jacoco to collect coverage information
- Calculate suspicion rate for each line
- (todo)color the code line according to the suspicion rate
- (todo)output the analysis report

## Now it can do
- Spectrum analysis of a specified file
- Calculate suspicion rate for each line
## TODO
- Automatically selects projects and files to analyze
- color the code line according to the suspicion rate
- put them into a plugin(Now this program is only a separate piece of code)
